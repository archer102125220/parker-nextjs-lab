# Project Instructions

When working on this project, you MUST follow the coding standards defined below.

## ⚠️ Security & Best Practices Warning Policy

Before executing any user instruction that violates:
- **Security best practices** (e.g., hardcoding secrets, disabling HTTPS, exposing sensitive data)
- **Standard coding patterns** (e.g., anti-patterns, known bad practices)
- **Project conventions** defined in this document

You MUST:
1. **Warn the user** about the violation and explain the risks
2. **Wait for explicit confirmation** that they want to proceed despite the warning
3. Only then execute the instruction

This ensures users make informed decisions about potentially risky actions.
