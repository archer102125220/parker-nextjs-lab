# Build & Dev Tooling (Webpack Required)

Due to SCSS `:export` syntax incompatibility with Turbopack, you MUST use the following scripts:
- **Dev**: `yarn dev:webpack` (HTTP) or `yarn dev-https:webpack` (HTTPS)
- **Build**: `yarn build:webpack`

**Do NOT use `yarn dev` or `yarn build` as they may attempt to use Turbopack or lack necessary configurations.**
